The Darkroom Timer
==============

A timer for film development

A quick personal tool I made over a weekend to help me time film development at home. You can find the running app [here](https://jerome-arfouche.com/darkroom).


### notes
- To run the app in development, first run `npm install`, then `npm run dev`  
- For production, run `npm run build`, and upload `/dist` to your server  
- Make sure `index.html` and `.htaccess` are not routing from subdirectory `/darkroom`
