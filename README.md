The Darkroom Timer
==============

A timer for film development

A quick personal tool I made over a weekend to help me time film development at home. You can find the running app [here](http://jerome-arfouche.com/darkroom).


### notes
- The only css used is darkroom.css, the others were minifcation tests, the js used is from CDN.  
- You can use space to pause/resume while the timer is running, faster than clicking.  
- Once the timer starts, you can bookmark the page with the parameters in the URL to come back to it later. It's a quick way to save development "recipes", eg: TriX in Rodinal
